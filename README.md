Home media server
Next-Generation Media Server
Overview
This project aims to develop a next-generation media server that combines the convenience of cloud services with the privacy and control of self-hosting. By leveraging a hybrid architecture and peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming capabilities, the server addresses common challenges faced by traditional home media servers, such as scalability, bandwidth limitations, and complex configurations.

Features
Simplified Deployment: A single binary executable, written in Go, ensures easy installation across multiple platforms.
Hybrid Cloud Architecture: Utilizes a minimal cloud service for authentication and peer coordination, enhancing accessibility without compromising user control.
P2P Streaming: Implements a BitTorrent-based protocol to facilitate efficient media distribution among trusted peers.
Adaptive Bitrate Streaming: Supports HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) with multiple quality profiles to accommodate varying network conditions.
Responsive Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly frontend for media management and playback, accessible from any device.
Robust Security: Incorporates end-to-end encryption, secure authentication, and fine-grained access controls to protect user data and privacy.
